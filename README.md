02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio     
The  assignment  was  to create a web application from scratch that resembles a portfolio page    
The core skills involved in create the page included FLEXBOX, MEDIA QUERIES and CSS    
    
My portfolio sections include:    

- About   
- Work     
- Contact

The navigation bar contains clickable tabs that take the viewer to the specific section and the 'work' section contain clickable images, which enlarge when the mouse hovers over them, that link to the specific projects I have completed. 

FLEXBOX and MEDIA QUERY were used in the CSS page to make the website responsive depending on the viewport size.
